# Pagination-Content-Filter
In this project, worked on enhancing the usability of a web page that has too much information. 

 To make it easier to find information and read the page, use of progressive enhancement to add pagination and search filter.  
 
 The page includes a list of 54 students. Aim is to add programming to display 10 students per page, and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students. 
 
 In addition, dynamically adding a search field so that users can search through the list of students.
